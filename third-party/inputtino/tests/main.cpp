#define CATCH_CONFIG_MAIN // This tells Catch to provide a main() - only do this in one cpp file
#include "catch2/catch_all.hpp"

/**
 * THIS FILE NEEDS TO BE LEFT EMPTY
 * This allows us to compile the catch main once and then,
 * when changing any test, compiling only them without rebuild it all.
 *
 * Greatly decreases compilation times!!!
